- Searching For Nessy.
- PDF: [Nessy](https://onlinejudge.org/external/110/11044.pdf)

## Description:

> Given a grid of n rows and m columns representing the loch, 6 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000,
> find the minimum number s of sonar beams you must put in the square such that we 
> can control every position in the grid, with the following conditions:

-Conditions: 
- • one sonar occupies one position in the grid; the sonar beam controls its
    own cell and the contiguous cells;
- • the border cells do not need to be controlled, because Nessy cannot hide
    there (she is too big).
