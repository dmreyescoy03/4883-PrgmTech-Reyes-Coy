# 4883-Programming-Techniques
## Repo: 4883
- Progamming Techniques: The class will be using programming problems from
 [UVA Online Judge](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php) in-order to get students
 familiar with competitive programming along with developing critical thinking/
 problem solving skills. This will not only help students become better programmers,
 but it will help them during interviews when they are thrown a problem to solve.
 (based on my opinion. Course is taught at [MSU texas](https://msutexas.edu/))
